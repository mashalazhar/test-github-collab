<h2>MISSION AND VISION</h2>

  <p>Defenders of Wildlife is dedicated to the protection of all native animals and plants in their natural communities. Founded in 1947, Defenders of Wildlife is a major national conservation organization focused solely on wildlife and habitat conservation and the safeguarding of biodiversity. We believe in the inherent value of wildlife and the natural world, and this singular focus defines our important niche in the environmental and conservation community and serves as the anchor for our organizational values. Defenders’ approach is direct and straightforward - We protect and restore imperiled species throughout North America by transforming policies and institutions and promoting innovative solutions – and this approach makes a lasting difference for wildlife and its habitat.</p>

<h2>ADVOCATING FOR INTERNATIONAL SPECIES</h2>

  <p>Throughout our country’s history, many of our iconic, native species – from the American alligator to the North American river otter – have had brushes with extinction due to demand for their fur, skin, feathers, or other features. When wildlife is viewed as little more than a commodity and its trade goes unchecked, species can disappear forever. The illegal wildlife trade is estimated to be worth $7-23 billion, making it the fourth largest illegal trade by dollar value, after drugs, guns, and humans. The United States is one of the largest consumers of both legal and illegal wildlife in the world, and the role we can play in preventing this exploitation and combatting wildlife trafficking is crucial. At Defenders of Wildlife, we cherish all wildlife and recognize the need for our leadership in this fight.</p>
